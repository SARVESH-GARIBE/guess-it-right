# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (JavaScript)

A simple number guessing game built with JavaScript that runs directly in the browser console. The game randomly generates a number within a range defined by the user, and the player keeps guessing until they get it right or decide to quit.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to **enter a maximum number** — this sets the range (1 to max).
2. A random number is generated within that range.
3. The user then guesses numbers using prompt boxes.
4. The game provides helpful hints:
   - "Your guess was too small"
   - "Your guess was too large"
5. If the user types `"quit"`, the game ends.
6. If the user guesses the number, a congratulatory message is shown.
